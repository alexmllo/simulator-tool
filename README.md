## Features

- **Daily Production Simulation**: Simulate production processes day by day
- **Inventory Management**: Track and manage raw materials and finished products
- **Order Management**: Handle production orders and purchase orders
- **Real-time Event Tracking**: Monitor production events and system status
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize production metrics and system state
- **Historical Analysis**: Review past production events and performance

## Architecture

The application is built with a modern tech stack:

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Frontend**: Angular 19
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Simulation Engine**: SimPy for discrete event simulation

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd simulator-tool
   ```

2. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:4200
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8080

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to run the application without Docker:

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

#### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The backend will be available at: http://localhost:8000

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   The application will be available at: http://localhost:4200

## üìä Usage

1. Access the application through your web browser at http://localhost:4200
2. Use the simulator interface to:
   - View the current simulation day
   - Advance the simulation day by day
   - Monitor production events
   - Track inventory levels
   - Manage production orders
   - View historical data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The application uses Docker volumes to persist the database data
- The frontend is configured to communicate with the backend through Docker's internal network
- If you need to change the backend URL, update the `serverUrl` variable in the Angular service
